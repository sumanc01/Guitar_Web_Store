		<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
		<h4>A Les Paul Standard with f-holes and flame maple top.</h4>

		<p>
			The Les Paul Standard is one of the most famous and sought-after electric guitars in the world. And now, Epiphone has added a twist to this classic rocker by including a gorgeous flame maple top with dual "f" holes, and a partially hollowed-out body that gives the legendary Les Paul a fresh upscale look with a lighter, more resonant body. It's the perfect combination of Les Paul sound and Epiphone style. Plus, the LP Standard Florentine PRO features Epiphone acclaimed ProBucker humbucker pickups, both with coil-tapping for a "standard" in looks and performance.<br>

			AAA Flame Maple Top and Classic<br>
			The Epiphone Ltd Ed Les Paul Standard Florentine PRO features a mahogany body that is carved out with two traditional f-holes for a new look that combines the Les Paul profile with Epiphone's legendary archtops. The Les Paul Florentine PRO features a beautiful AAA flame maple veneer top that delivers the classic LP tone and sustain but with the hint of a semi-hollowbody guitar like a 335 or Sheraton. The body also features single-ply cream binding on the top for a beautiful vintage look.<br>

			Like all Epiphone Les Pauls-and unlike less costly designs-the Epiphone Les Paul Standard Florentine PRO features a 14-degree angled headstock that gives you more pressure at the nut for longer sustain with less tuning hang-ups caused by "string-tree" gadgets. The mahogany neck has a standard 24.75" scale with a 12" radius and features a 1960s SlimTaper "D" profile with a glued-in neck joint for lifelong stability. The "D" profile neck is easy to hold for hours of playing time. The smooth rosewood fingerboard comes with pearloid trapezoid inlays, 22 medium-jumbo frets, a 1.68" nut, and 1-ply cream binding.<br>

			Epiphone ProBucker Humbuckers with Coil-Tapping<br>
			The Ltd Ed Les Paul Florentine PRO now features ProBucker pickups for that one-of-a kind Les Paul sound. ProBucker pickups feature Alnico II magnets, the same magnets used in sought-after vintage PAF humbuckers. Alnico II magnets provide a rich, warm tone with a sparkling high end and a solid low end. And, like PAF-era humbuckers, Epiphone ProBucker pickups are incredibly responsive with a range of tones.<br>

			The Les Paul Standard Florentine PRO features a ProBucker-2 in the neck position and a ProBucker-3 in the bridge position. The ProBucker-3 is slightly overwound to provide balance with the neck pickup and a bit of edge for lead work. ProBuckers emulate the sound of original PAF pickups which were hand-wound with a few extra turns of wire. Both the neck and bridge pickups also feature coil-tapping which is easily activated by a push/pull volume control. Coil tapping allows players an infinite variety of pickups sounds from single-coil bark to full humbucker bite.<br>

			Epiphone ProBucker Power<br>
			Epiphone pickups are critically acclaimed for their vintage-perfect sound and superior workmanship. When winding its humbuckers, Epiphone utilizes a double vacuum waxing process that ensures quiet operation, free from microphonic hum. The pickup is first placed in the specialized wax vacuuming system before the cover is placed on the unit to ensure that the wax fully penetrates to the very center of the pickup and solidifies all parts. After the cover is placed on, it is again given a second vacuum wax bath until the unit is completely saturated with wax. Epiphone uses only the highest-quality parts for its pickups, such as ABS plastic bobbins, 1010 Cold Rolled Steel pole shoes and pole screws, Alnico magnets and the finest magnet wire available. A guitar with Epiphone ProBucker pickups is a guitar you can truly play for life.<br>

			Guaranteed PRO Hardware<br>
			Epiphone's Ltd Ed Les Paul Standard Florentine PRO features Epiphone's legendary rock-solid hardware including a LockTone Tune-o-matic fully adjustable bridge and a Stopbar tailpiece. And now, Epiphone's updated design auto locks the bridge and tailpiece in place with no tools needed for improved sustain. The Les Paul Standard Florentine PRO uses 1" diameter potentiometers for better "throw," longer life and reliable service. Epiphone's all-metal toggle switches use rugged spring-steel contacts to ensure years of reliable service and performance. And Epiphone's proprietary output jack features an improved contact shape and a heavy-duty spring steel to increase reliability. Tuning is easy fast, and intuitive with Epiphone new "Deluxe" machine heads with an 18:1 ratio to ensure tuning stability and long life.<br>
